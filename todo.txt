add examples of how FuncyCss can do mixin, inheritence, etc....

show of that styles can be changed in real time

explain lots more NOTE THATs


show off my favorite of if img onerror that reloads

add some color stuff, for example:

   color_rgb or color_rgba will take hex, or arrays, or something like that

   also add a couple of functions to merge colors together, but try to keep it basic
